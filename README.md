### Smart Doorbell System with Facial Recognition and Live Notifications

This project involves connecting two Arduino devices with a live server to create an advanced doorbell system featuring facial recognition. The system identifies visitors at the door and sends real-time text and voice notifications to the homeowner, announcing the visitor's identity. This integration of hardware and software provides enhanced security and convenience, allowing users to know who is at their door without having to physically check.

Key Features:
- **Facial Recognition:** Utilizes advanced algorithms to accurately identify individuals.
- **Live Notifications:** Sends instant text and voice alerts to the homeowner's device.
- **Dual Arduino Connection:** Ensures robust communication and functionality.
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Offers continuous surveillance and prompt visitor identification.

This smart doorbell system was made in particular to assist the deaf and blind.
